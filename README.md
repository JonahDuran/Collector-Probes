# Collector-Probes

These are files related to the creation and accessing of the deposition probe MDSplus tree. The file "pull_data_dp" includes functions that will pull data from the tree located on the server r2d2. Inorder to work, the following line must be added to your .bash profile: export dp_probes_path='r2d2.gat.com::' This tells the programs where to find the tree. 

A LaTeX file exists that describes the MDSplus tree, and what each node represents. Email Shawn Zamperini at zamp@utk.edu with questions.
